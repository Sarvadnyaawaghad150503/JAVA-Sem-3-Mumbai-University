Question : - Five Bikers Compete in
a race such that they drive
at a constant speed which
may or may not be
the same as the other. To
qualify the race, the speed
of a racer must be more
than the average
speed of all 5 racers.
Write a Java program to
take as input the speed of
each racer and print back
the speed of qualifying racers

code:

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Speed_bikers {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Scanner S=new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("speed of 1st biker ");
float first=S.nextFloat();
System.out.printf(" %f\n\n",first);
System.out.println("speed of 2nd biker ");
float Sec=S.nextFloat();
System.out.printf(" %f\n\n",Sec);
System.out.println("speed of 3rd biker ");
float Third=S.nextFloat();
System.out.printf(" %f\n\n",Third);
System.out.println("speed of 4th biker ");
float fourth=S.nextFloat();
System.out.printf(" %f\n\n",fourth);
System.out.println("speed of 5th biker ");
float fifth=S.nextFloat();
System.out.printf(" %f\n\n",fifth);
float Average= (first + Sec + Third + fourth + fifth)/5 ;
System.out.println("\nAverage of all bikers:"+Average);
if(first>Average) {
System.out.printf("\nFirst qualified \nHis speed is %f \n", first);
}
else{
System.out.print("\nFirst dissqualified\n");
}
if(Sec>Average) {
System.out.printf("\nSecond qualified \nHis speed is %f \n", Sec);

}
else{
System.out.print("\nSecond dissqualified\n");
}
if(Third>Average) {
System.out.printf("\nThird qualified \nHis speed is %f\n ", Third);
}
else{
System.out.printf("\nThird dissqualified\n");
}
if(fourth>Average) {
System.out.printf("\nfourth qualified \nHis speed is %f \n", fourth);
}
else{
System.out.print("\nFourth dissqualified\n");
}
if(fifth>Average) {
System.out.printf("\nfifth qualified \nHis speed is %f\n ", fifth);
}
else{
System.out.print("\nfifth dissqualified\n");
}
}
}
