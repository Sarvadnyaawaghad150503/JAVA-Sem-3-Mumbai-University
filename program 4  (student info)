String address;

students(String n, int age, String add){
name = n;
this.age = age;
address= add;
}

students(){
name = "Unknown";
age = 0;
address = "not available";
}
void print(){
System.out.println(name);
System.out.println(age);
System.out.println(address);

public static void main(String args[]){
students s1 = new students();
students s2 = new students("om",10,"chembur");
